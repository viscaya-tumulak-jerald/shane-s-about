                    "My Name is Shane Mary Viscaya, a 20-year-old College Student from Cordova Public College.
                     I am taking the course Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. I am currently living in Mandaue City, which is my birthplace, but I grew up in Looc, Lapu-Lapu City with my family.
                     My life has been full of challenges, but I am grateful for them because they have inspired me to become a better person. I believe that life is too short to be taken seriously, and I strive to live it to the fullest each day.
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     I believe that education is the key to success, and I am committed to making the most of my college experience. I am an active participant in my classes, and I enjoy learning from my professors and peers. I am also involved in extracurricular activities, such as sports and volunteer work, which enable me to develop my communication and leadership skills."
